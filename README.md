# About me

Nice to meet you. I'm Je-hwan Yoo, a `backend developer`. I'm also proficient enough in `frontend development` to make a living.

I majored in Computer Science and Engineering and focused on `Node.js` during my undergraduate years. Now, I mainly work with `Nest.js` as my primary framework.

I favor `MongoDB` for NoSQL databases and know how to work with `PostgreSQL` for relational databases.

I'm skilled in implementing both `RESTful` and `GraphQL`. Recently, I've been exploring the use of `gRPC`.

I am cloud-native, with expertise in `AWS`. For simple full-stack services, I use platforms like `Amplify` and `Vercel`. I have developed a habit of `dockerizing` all my development environments.

Currently, I am learning how to develop and manage microservice architectures.

I favor development paradigms such as `Functional Programming`, `Dependency Injection (DI)`, `Test-Driven Development (TDD)`, and `Domain-Driven Design (DDD)`.
